                Do you find yourself pulling out your iPhone to check Facebook, Twitter, your email but not really interested in anything you see? How about interacting with other people in the same predicament as you?

                <b>WaitMate</b> is an iOS application meant to give you something to do while you're waiting at a bus stop or train stop.

                <p>
                No personal information will be taken from <b>WaitMate</b>. The only thing <b>WaitMate</b> does is have you ask questions and get answers to those questions. The questions and answers are recorded and anyone with <b>WaitMate</b> can see those qustions and answers. WaitMate will not record your location either. If it asks to use your location you're probably doing something wrong.
