                <b>WaitMate</b> is an iOS application meant to give you something to do while you're waiting at a bus stop or train stop. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Why do you pull out your phone and check Facebook? Check Twitter? Check your email? There's never anything interesting going on! Why not interact with other people who are also waiting?
                </p>

            <div id="disclaimer">
                <p>
                No personal information will be taking from <b>WaitMate</b>. The only thing <b>WaitMate</b> does is have you ask questions and get answers to those questions. The questions and answers are recorded and anyone with <b>WaitMate</b> can see those qustions and answers. WaitMate will not record your location either. If it asks to use your location you're probably doing something wrong.
                </p>
