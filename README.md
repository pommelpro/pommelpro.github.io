This game is made to run on a mobile device. You must make sure that the web browser is able to use your location.

When you play the game, you will have two minutes to find pictures. Click "get started" to start the game. When you 
find a picture that fits the category click the "capture it" button which will open the camera so you can take a picture.
When the picture is taken, you move onto the next category (or the same category depending on the game). 

At the end of the game, you can see the pictures you've taken or the pictures that others have taken.
